            <p> We are solely focusing  on bridging the digital divide that is on the rise due to the 4iR wave that the globe is in currently. Rather than reskilling those in the work environment, the foundation of the future lies in how the education system is operating thus this organisation seeks to prepare the education system to meet the demands of the new industries that are technological centric. </p>

                Case examination of the 3 schools and do research that presents all ICT implemented failed projects and investigating what went wrong and how can it be addressed. This is a preliminary stage of how the projects will be conducted. How the schools are chosen is first to be checking those that have Computer labs.  
Prospective challenges of lack of use of comp labs
•	Network issues (which broadband is in the region) solution is to meet with those network providers with network that is reaching the school then they have to supply the network  (((STARLINK)))
•	Electricity (solar systems on the lab) 
•	Human resources skills (educator and technician) solution is to meet with SGB to plan on how to have those who do regular checks per month and paid, involve government to have teachers for computer subjects 
•	Infrastructures (computers, routers, projectors, the building itself)
