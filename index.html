<section class="strategies" id="strategies">
    <h2 class="heading-strategy"> Our <span>Strategy</span></h2>
    <p>Mzizi-Yethu The foundational strategy that Mzizi-Yethu Foundation is identified with is called The R & D model. This is the cornerstone of the entity which stresses the importance of addressing a problem using the bottom-up strategy (i.e., from grassroots Mzizi) and equally valuing research and development to drive progress. Grassroots innovation refers to novel solutions developed at the community level, often in response to local challenges and needs. Instead of top-down, solutions created from bottom-up processes using formal R & D driven by local contexts have high magnitude of success. Mzizi-Yethu R & D model is founded on four core pillars: </p>
    <div class="strategies-container">
        <div class="strategies-box">
            <h3>Genchi Genbutsu concept</h3>
            <p>Mzizi-Yethu R & D model as the name of the organisation entails the foundational pillar is going to the place where the problem is 
                in order to solve that problem more quickly and efficiently.
                 The term Genchi Genbutsu is borrowed from the Toyota Production System of root cause analysis at the site to ensure that the solution at all times will be tailored to specific local conditions, cultures, and needs.</p>

        <div class="strategies-box">
            <h3>Kushiriki</h3>
            <p>A Swahili term for participation is another core pillar that gives the Mzizi-Yethu R & D model a high degree of community participation, not just in terms of ideation and creation, but this seeks to foster social cohesion to restore the value of unity in communities rather than competition</p>

        </div>
        <div class="strategies-box">
            <h3>Uwezeshaji</h3>
            <p> A Swahili term for empowerment. This pillar is directly linked to the Kushiriki pillar. Communities have ecosystems which only they know how best to navigate and improve their ecosystem, thus Mzizi-Yethu R & D only empower local communities by providing them with tools or methods to solve their problems, thus fostering self-reliance.</p>

        <div class="strategies-box">
            <h3>Seitai Moho</h3>
            <p> It is a Japanese term that means biomimicry. As a result of the global outcry of the need for sustainable solution, Mzizi-Yethu R & D modelâ€™s last pillar is going to the community nature to learn how to sustain the community. </p>
